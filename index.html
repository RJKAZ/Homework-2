                <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. My offical legal name is Richard Paul Kazanowski Jr, but you can
                    call me by my more widley used nickname RJ! </p>
            
                <p>My main interest and above all passion in this world.....is International Travel! As of Septmeber of 2019, I
                    have visited by my count 78 countries in the world. Of those 78 countries, I have set foot on 6 of the 7
                    continents (however briefly) and have literally been to every single country in Europe. Yes, even the more
                    remote countries on that continent, such as Belarus, San Marino, Transnistia, Sark, & Kosovo, among others.</p>

              <p>Roughly there are 195 countries in the world, while visiting them all one day might be a personal goal of mine,
                  for the time being I'll be content with just cracking 100. Needless to say I have seen some incredible places,
                  meet some facinating people, and have tried many unique foods.</p>
          
                <p>Another interest of mine is digital art, Always hating the mess and smell of traditional art mediums, I took to
                  digital art around 2005 and since then it has been my most enduring hobby thus far!</p>
