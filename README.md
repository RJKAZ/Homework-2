# Homework-2
Bootstrap 

Ok, so for this assignment I deviated quite substantially from the original design of homework-1

I had personal favorite background image I wanted to use add jazzed it up a bit in photoshop. 

The first page was quite difficult because my goal was to sort of have everything revolve around the globe image in the center. In that regard I think I mostly succeeded......The text containers however were somewhat nightmarish. Originally I was using the card components to put both text and pictures......but given my background image I couldn't get it to look the way I wanted. So while the navbar is pure bootstrap...the content box and the floated images are not, just regular HTML/CSS.......but I was able to get it kind of looking how I envisioned it. On the matter of the text....overall I'm not happy with how they turned out visually....but as said, my goal was to get everything kind of revolving the earth. 

The Gallery page was hours of trial and error. I resorted to Google-fu-ing and found no shortage of Bootstrap image gallery templates.....but most of them I couldn't get to work quite right....even using the correlating CSS or Javascript. I found one HTML only template....and it seems to have worked. I really wanted to get a Carosel styled image galley....but couldn't get it to roll thur the images no matter what I tried. 

Contact Page....thats just right from Bootstrap.
